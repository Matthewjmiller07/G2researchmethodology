This project is an interactive "G2 Methodology Trainer" designed to help users understand the core concepts behind G2's approach to categorizing, scoring, and reporting on software products and services. Built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript, it presents users with scenarios and common misunderstandings related to G2's methods. Users are challenged to provide correct explanations based on the official G2 Research Methodology documentation.   

The trainer covers key areas such as G2's core research principles (authenticity, transparency, objectivity, buyer-focus), product/service categorization rules, the components of G2 Scores (Satisfaction and Market Presence), factors influencing these scores (like review age/quality and vendor web presence), and the different types of G2 market reports (including Grid®, Index, and Momentum reports). It provides immediate feedback on the user's answers, reinforcing learning through an engaging, quiz-like format styled according to G2's brand guidelines.
